# fmIDE
[A FileMaker Integrated Development Environment]

[fmIDE](https://github.com/fmIDE/fmIDE) is a module for FileMaker files which it makes it possible for tools to 'deep link' into the FileMaker Development Environment.

# BaseElements

![BaseElements Logo](https://baseelements.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/logo_BaseElements.png)

[BaseElements](http://www.fm-crosscheck.com) is a FileMaker analysis tool from [Goya](https://goya.com.au/).

# Script "fmIDE-Go to Thing from BaseElements"

[The `fmIDE-Go to Thing from BaseElements` script](Script-fmIDE-Go-to-Thing-from-BaseElements.txt) is the bridge between BaseElements and your database solutions (using the [fmIDE-'Name-that-Thing' API](https://github.com/fmIDE/fmIDE/wiki/fmIDE-'Name-that-Thing'-API))

In one click it jumps from the thing you are currently looking at in BaseElements directly to that thing in your database.
